Flight time (5-8 sec) and lbr guidance make it essentially immune to countermeasures. Because of the high velocity, the system exceeds the hit probability of cometing systems agaisnt high-speed aitcraft on receding flight paths. The startstreak's lower cost and capabilities as a mulit-role missile system offers varied uses. Two considerations are the semi-automoatic command line-of-sight (saclos) guidance and contact fuzes which make it less effective agaisnt agile fixed-wing aircraft from some aspects. Thus a more practical course wold be to replace 33-50% of the manpads. With the lower cost of starstreak and its multi-ole capability, it could replace a portion of the expensive single-role manpads with starstreaks, for instance, an 18-manpads battery could be reduced 35%.",

Due to the large size of the weapon and the weight of the ammunition (130 kg for a standard projectile) it has a slow rate of fire: one round per minute. In addition to the high explosive bombs, it can fire armour-piercing, chemical and nuclear rounds. It can also fire the \"Smel'chak\" (\"Daredevil\"), a laser-guided round. The Tyulpan is currently the heaviest mortar in deployment among any country.",

But the cruciform-based single-tube ground launcher system exceeds the weight limit for the portable class of ATGM launchers. Thus it will rarely be dismounted. However, the launcher can be mounted on a variety of vehicles. Most use a simple pintle mount. The single-tube dismountable HOT firing station can be fitted on light vehicles such as the VBL. Thus the OPFOR Tier 2 battalion ATGM launcher was previously a HOT-3 pintle mount version on the VBL.

Vehicle does fit well into tightly congested areas such as forest trails. A variety of atgm systems can be mounted on the vehicle sucht as the at-4 fagot (9p135), at-5 konkurs, trigan, & milan. The most lethal of these options is the trigan that mounts onto a milan launcher adapter.",

The M1129 is used in the US Army Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, where it is part of each Brigade's maneuver infantry battalion's and RSTA squadron's MTOE (Modified Table of Equipment). The vehicles are either organically subordinated to battalion level or company level. The battalion level vehicles are armed with the RMS6L 120MM mortar system, which is the vehicle mounted version of the RMS6L 120MM mortar. Additionally, they carry the 81mm M252 mortar that can only be used in a dismounted capacity. The company level vehicles also carry a vehicle-mounted 120mm mortar, which is augmented by the 60mm M224 mortar for dismounted use. The RSTA squadron only receives the 120mm mounted mortar, there is no augmentation dismounted maneuvers. Each Stryker infantry battalion thus has a total number of 10 mortar carriers, all of which are equipped with the 120mm system. Each Stryker RSTA battalion has a total of 6 mortar carriers, all of which are also equipped with the 120mm system.",

The HIMARS carries six rockets or one MGM-140 ATACMS missile on the U.S. Army's new Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) five-ton truck, and can launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System Family of Munitions (MFOM). HIMARS ammunition is interchangeable with the MLRS M270A1, however it is only able to carry one pod rather than the standard two for the M270 and A1 variants. It was designed as a small, mobile, MLRS, with the ability to 'shoot-and-scoot'. The launcher is C-130 transportable.",

Highly mobile, designed for modern armored ground warfare, the M1 is well armed and heavily armored. Notable features include the use of a powerful multifuel turbine engine, the adoption of sophisticated composite armor, and separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment for crew safety. Weighing nearly 68 short tons (almost 62 metric tons), it is one of the heaviest main battle tanks in service. The M1 Abrams entered U.S. service in 1980, ultimately replacing the M60 tank.The M1 is the main battle tank of the United States Army and Marine Corps, along with the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Iraq. Three main versions of the M1 Abrams have been deployed, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, incorporating improved armament, protection, and electronics. These improvements and other upgrades to in-service tanks have allowed this long-serving vehicle to remain in front-line service. In addition, development of the improved M1A3 version was first publicly disclosed in 2009. Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest M1A2 SEPv3 version.",

The weapon can fire guided and unguided projectiles up to 42 km (26 mi). Firing ballistic missiles, such as the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), it can hit targets 300 km (190 mi) away; the warhead in such shots reaches an altitude of about 50 km (164,000 ft). The M270 can be used in shoot-and-scoot tactics, firing its rockets rapidly, then moving away to avoid counter-battery fire. MLRS was developed jointly by the United Kingdom, United States, West Germany, France and Italy. It was developed from the older General Support Rocket System (GSRS). The M270 MLRS weapons system is collectively known as the M270 MLRS Self-propelled Loader/Launcher (SPLL). The SPLL is composed of three primary subsystems: the M269 Loader Launcher Module (LLM), which also houses the electronic Fire Control System, is mated to the M993 Carrier Vehicle. The M993 is a derivative of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle chassis.",

Variants ending with -1 denote the engine replaced w/v-46 from t-72 mbt. The british l7 105-mm rifled gun has been used in several t-54/55/type 59 tank upgrade programs. Several more recent 105-mm rounds and tank fire control systems have been developed, to increase effectiveness of 105-mm tank guns. There are also now 120-mm low-recoil smoothbore tank guns, such as the compact tank gun (ctg), which fire standard unitary rounds, for t-54/55/type 59 upgrade programs. Optional sights and fire control systems include the israeli el-op red tiger and matador fcs, swedish nobeltech t-series sight, and german atlas molf. The serbian suv-t55a fcs, british marconi digital fcs, south african tiger, and belgian sabca titan offer upgraded function. One of the best is the slovenian efcs-3 integrated fcs. A romanian/french fcs upgrade package from tr-85m1 tank can be used on t-55 type tanks. It has hunter-killer fc, and thermal gunner sight. A variety of thermal sights are available, including the russian/french alis and namut-type sight from peleng. There are also thermal sights which permit night launch of atgms. T-55 with bdd or \"Bra armor\" (semi-circular add-on armor) have turret protection increased to 330 mm (ke) and 400-450 mm (ce). Other improvements available include a hull bottom reinforced against mines, better engines, rubber track pads, and a thermal sleeve for the gun. Some forces have added era, applique, or box armor to t-55 tanks. These protection improvements may give marginal improvement against older rounds up to 105 mm, but do not protect sufficiently to defeat most 120-125 mm apfsds-t rounds at 2000 m. They offer some degree of protection against some tier 4 and a few tier 3 atgl warheads and atgms, but not against more modern at weapons.",

The buran-pa cannot be used to launch the atgm. The 1g46 day sight can be used at night for launching atgms if the target is illuminated. A variety of thermal sights are available. They include the russian sanoet, french sagem-produced alis and namut sight from belorussian peleng.",

      "description": "The russian military decided against t90a for its forces. In sep 2011, they displayed t-90am as a deep modernization of t-90a. They include a low-profile turret with a bustle autoloader and blow-out panels. The new 2a82 gun fires a longer (700+ mm est) and heavier apfsds-t round to 3,500+ m the original version of the tank has an 840-hp diesel engine. The engine in subsequent models is upgraded. Engine options include 950, 1,000 and 1,100 hp. The original tank had an ii sight from the t-80 series (buran-pa, 800-1300 meters range). However, marketing materials feature the agava-2 thermal sight. Recent gen3 sights are available. These night sights permit night launch of atgms. Relikt 3d gen era is offered to replace kontakt-5 in several upgrade packages, or as a separate upgrade. The era adds up to 600 mm ce protection and 300 mm ke to turret base armor protection, or about 150 mm more than kontakt-5. Arena aps is available. Active protection systems. Defensive aides suite is shtora-1 (laser warning receiver with gun auto-slew, lwr-directed smoke grenade launchers, and eo-ir jammer), or partial package excluding ir jammers. None is on bhishma. The shtora-1 ir atgm countermeasure illuminators can be detected with night sights. Shtora-1 has no effect against most modern atgm systems, with encoded tracker beacons. Exclusion of shtora-1 offers more era on the turret front and reduces costs. Protection probably includes radar-absorbent materials and ir-resistant paint the t-90 may be fielded with full shtora-1 package (laser warning receiver with auto-slew gun capability, lwr-directed smoke grenade launchers, and eo-ir jammer), with a partial package, or without shtora-1. Shtora-1 illuminators can be used for night illumination. An improved gun, 2a46m-4, with improved accuracy and use life is available for fitting to the t-90. The bk-29 round, with a hard penetrator in the nose is designed for use against reactive armor, and as an mp round has fragmentation effects. The bk-27 heat round offers a triple-shaped charge warhead and 50 mm more penetration.The 12.7-mm mg nsvt has both remote electronically operated sight pzu-5 with vertical stabilization, night acquisition, and a gun-mounted k10-t reflex sight.",

      "description": "Launchers are maintained with chemical troops, but are often employed with artillery. Other applications include defoliation and mine clearing. A variety of enhanced blast mixtures (varying from improvised from common materials to sophisticated) can be used to produce thermobaric or fuel-air explosive (FAE) effects. The sophisticated mix for TOS-1 may be enhanced with powdered tetranite. The primary FAE effect is a long-duration high-pressure blast wave which creates a vacuum then precipitates a reverse wave. These pressure/vacuum surges (up to 427 pounds per sq inch) cause a ripping effect on soft materials (such as airplane skin, radar surface, human lung tissue). Walls and surfaces within the affected area do not necessarily shield victims, rather causing multiple pressure waves, which amplify the tearing effects and can topple structures. A secondary effect is high-temperature heat: 2,500-3,000 degrees  C. An incomplete explosion renders a near-devastating effect, wide-area long-duration high-temperature flame. Even those outside of the blast area will be rendered ineffective with debilitating mental and physical trauma. Primary TOS-1 use considerations are: (1) it works best under conditions which normally protect targets from weapons: (2) it has a high assurance of devastation within a large area. The TOS-1 is designed primarily for use against emplacements, defilade areas (such as terrain folds and tunnels), fighting positions, ships, buildings, as well as personnel and other soft targets. High angles-of-fire and steep impact angles support use in defilade and urban areas. Despite the seeming short range, the weapon was effectively used in Chechnya to disable defenders within a specific sector just prior to an assault, to halt assaults, and to level buildings.",

The missile is cooled by a disposable bottle of refrigerant. The bottle and launcher battery are useable for 30 seconds after activation. Because the nose extends past the launcher tube, the nose is protected with an extended cap which is removed before launching. Once the operator reaches the launch area, he will often remove the protective pad, and will remove the missile cap prior to use. Maximum speed for targets engaged varies from 320 m/s rear aspect, receding targets, to 360-400 m/s head-on, approaching targets. The gunner may have an optional portable electronic plotting board, which warns of location and direction of approaching target(s) with a display range of up to 12.5 km. For tier 1 and tier 2 opfor simulations and units operating from vehicles, this system and pelengator are likely. Missile seeker features a two-color seeker with improved proportional convergence logic, and an igla (needle) device on the seeker, with mirror and tripod to cool the seeker and facilitate more rigorous g-load turns with reduced seeker warming. With these features, the sa-16 offers superior maneuver and countermeasure resistance over the previous manpads, and a base level of precision against maneuvering aircraft that is similar to the sa-18. Nevertheless, this missile is more vulnerable to eo/ir decoy countermeasures than the later sa-18.",

      "description": "The sa-5/gammon is a long-range, strategic semi-active guided missile system for targeting mediumto- high altitude high-speed aircraft. The missile has a long cylindrical body with a conical nose, four long chord cruciform delta wings, four small cruciform rectangular control surfaces at the extreme rear, and four jettisonable, wraparound solid-fuel boosters with canted nozzles. It uses a liquid propellant, dual thrust rocket engine, and the missile travels about 2 km before booster separation. The sustainer has four cropped delta wings and steerable rear fins. Control is assisted by ailerons. There are reports that the square pair can be linked with and (perhaps) slaved to s-300p series target acquisition radar, to engage targets tracked by that radar. Thus an sa-10 or sa-20 unit could integrate launches with the sa-5b to engage targets beyond their own 200 km range (with limited threat from atmospheric systems), and could protect the sa-5 launchers with their ballistic missile capabilities. Sa-10/20 phased array radars greatly reduce detectable rf signal. Iran claims to have upgraded its systems with better radars and digital c2. ",

An identification friend or foe (iff) system can be fitted to the gunner/operator's helmet. Further, a supplementary early warning system consisting of a passive rf antenna and headphones can be used to provide early cue about the approach and rough direction of an enemy aircraft. The gunner may have an optional 1l15-1 portable electronic plotting board, which warns of location and direction of approaching target(s) with a display range of up to 12.5 km. A variety of night sights are available, including 1 gen ii (2,000-3,500), 2 gen ii (4,500), and thermal sight (5,000-6,000). British ring sights permit ii night sight to be mounted to any manpads.",

In addition to the low radar cross section, the boat is also extremely fast with an aluminum monohull with stepped planning and the catamaran design also provides better seaworthiness in comparison to the other boats of similar displacement with a conventional hull. The missile boats have been successfully exported to Iran, where since 2000 it has been in service with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy Corps.

Similar craft are marketed by a firm located in singapore, and according to news reports, craft similar to the nk silc were delivered to iran.

These 50-100 ton ships are operated by naval spf forces and are disguised as large, commercial fishing vessels, not unlike large fishing vessel imother shipsi or freighters which have one or two underwater doors concealed on the stern, to launch semisubmersible craft. Some mother ships are actually intelligence ships, again disguised as large fishing vessels or freighters, with an array of intercept, reconnaissance, and radio systems, as well as semisubmersible craft.

The A-10 was designed for close air support (CAS) of friendly ground troops, attacking armored vehicles and tanks, and providing quick-action support against enemy ground forces. It entered service in 1976 and is the only production-built aircraft that has served in the USAF that was designed solely for CAS. Its secondary mission is to provide forward air controller - airborne (FAC-A) support, by directing other aircraft in attacks on ground targets. Aircraft used primarily in this role are designated OA-10.",

A full one-third of the fuel on board cannot be used for this reason. The same limitation effectively reduces mach 2 flight time to perfunctory high-speed tests. The mig-21 is a simple, reliable aircraft with honest flying characteristics. It is also considered to be a competent dog-fighter against most western aircraft. India has suffered an almost incredible string of mig-21 crashes since 1998, including several notable incidents that have killed people on the ground. From january 1998 to december 2002 there were over 50 mig-21 crashes, including three that killed a total of 13 people on the ground. Analysts are debating if the age of the aircraft is an issue or if there are serious errors in pilot training.

Named after the Native American war leader Black Hawk, the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the Bell UH-1 Iroquois as the Army's tactical transport helicopter. This was followed by the fielding of electronic warfare and special operations variants of the Black Hawk. Improved UH-60L and UH-60M utility variants have also been developed. Modified versions have also been developed for the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. In addition to U.S. Army use, the UH-60 family has been exported to several nations.

      "description": "The Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) Tiger is a four-bladed, twin-engined attack helicopter which first entered service in 2003. It is manufactured by Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters), the successor company to Aerospatiale's and DASA's respective helicopter divisions, which designate it as the EC665. Following their languages, in Germany it is known as the Tiger; in France and Spain it is called the Tigre. Development of the Tiger started during the Cold War, and it was initially intended as an anti-tank helicopter platform to be used against a Soviet ground invasion of Western Europe. During its prolonged development period the Soviet Union collapsed, but France and Germany chose to proceed with the Tiger, developing it instead as a multirole attack helicopter. It achieved operational readiness in 2008. The Tiger has the distinction of being the first all-composite helicopter developed in Europe; even the earliest models also incorporate other advanced features such as a glass cockpit, stealth technology, and high agility to increase its survivability. Improved variants have since entered service, outfitted with more powerful engines and compatible with a wider range of weapons. Since the type's introduction to service, Tigers have been used in combat in Afghanistan, Libya, and Mali.",

The j-7 aircraft was the most widely produced chinese fighter, replacing older j-6 fighters, the chinese version of the mig-19. In 1995 it was projected that j-7 production would continue for at least another decade, resulting in a total inventory of nearly 1000 aircraft by 2005, but the plaaf inventory has remained at about 500 aircraft, suggesting that production was either suspended or terminated.
